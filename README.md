# YouTube Navbar

## Steps

- Fork the next [pen](https://codepen.io/muktek/pen/MQjrEQ) into your Codepen account.

**Don’t touch the HTML. You can only add classes to existing elements.**

## What’s the deal

- You are using [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to render “X” icon, please read the documentation to render the correct one, see illustration. The syntax to render an icon using that library is: `fa fa-iconName`.
